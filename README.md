# Masternaut Development Task

## Getting Started
The aim of the task is to read the scenario and produce an application that fulfills the requirements listed below.

We have included a base app as a starting point.

To build & run the app you should install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and then run the following:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The base app is written using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). The bundle is generated using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) has been included as a basic UI framework.

## Scenario
PastaNaut is the UKs leading takeaway delivery business and has decided to provide their clients with a page where they can track the progress of their customers deliveries.

Your task is to extend the provided code with functionality and logic to display delivery data which is included in the 'data.json' file in the root of the application.

### Requirements

 - Include a way for clients to view their customers deliveries
 - Highlight which is the current delivery
 - Show the total journey time

It's up to you how you display the data, this can be anything from a stylised list to plotting the full journey route on the map. You can extend the application in any way you feel is necessary to achieve the task and feel free to also include your own features.

Good luck!
